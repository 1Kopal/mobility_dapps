# Decentralized Carpool (Toyota Hackathon)

A decentralized carpool app on ethereum blockchain.

# Install

TODO
This dapp was built using the [Truffle Dapp Development Framework](http://truffleframework.com/). If you would like to deploy this dapp locally for testing the easiest way to do that is to install [Truffl](http://truffleframework.com/) and the [testrpc Ethereum client](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc).

After installing

# Installing
You will need to be running testrpc in one terminal instance and Truffle in a second one. This can be accomplished by opening 2 separate terminal windows or using a program like `screen` if you use a Linux based OS. After installing Truffle and testrpc:


Terminal Window 1:

1. Start `testrpc` with settings to your liking (it is a good idea to unlock accounts when starting `testrpc` so you can more easily interact with the contracts).

Terminal Window 2:

2. ```Bash
truffle compile
```

3. ```Bash
truffle migrate
```
